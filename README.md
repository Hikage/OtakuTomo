This Chrome extension is designed to be an otaku (fan) tomo (friend), aiding in the search for web-based fansub streaming sites provided a given anime.  Users will be able to provide a series and optionally a season and/or episode, as well as specify English dub (official or fandubs) or Japanese with English subtitles (fansubs).  Tomo will then search for available sites providing the given series, ranked based on a number of criteria, including:  
*  Healthy videos (vs. broken links)  
*  Number of ads on site  
*  Popups detected  
*  Chat sidebars

Users will also be able to contribute to ratings based on experiences, improving accuracy with future recommendations.

Once options have been determined, they will be presented to the user.
  
  
Optional enhancements include:  
*  Automatically queuing up the selected video, bypassing any pre-video ads
*  Prompting the user to advance to the next episode in the series
*  Alternatively automatically bookmarking the next episode to resume at a later date
  
  
Planned increments:
*  Basic:
